**Agentic Architect** | Ex-Amazon Alexa Tech Lead | Seattle

I build the connective tissue of the Agentic Web—secure, production-grade infrastructure that lets AI agents safely interact with real-world systems.

## What I'm Building

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem is in its "wild west" phase. Most implementations are demo-ware. I'm building **reference implementations** that show how it should be done:

| Project | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [splitwise-mcp](https://github.com/vishnujayvel/splitwise-mcp) | Financial reconciliation agent with duplicate prevention | ![Production Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Production%20Ready-10b981) |
| discord-mcp *(coming soon)* | Event-driven community management with context engineering | ![In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Development-f59e0b) |

## My Engineering Philosophy

> *"The market isn't looking for coders—it's flooded with AI-generated code. It's starving for architects who can constrain, guide, and secure the probabilistic nature of AI to do useful, deterministic work."*

**I believe in:**

- **ADRs over assumptions** — Document the "why", not just the "what"
- **Production over prototypes** — Anyone can wrap an API. Few can make it enterprise-ready
- **Context engineering** — Solving "Lost in the Middle" is the real LLM orchestration challenge
